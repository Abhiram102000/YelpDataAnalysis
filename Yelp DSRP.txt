Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM attribute

ii. Business table = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM business

iii. Category table = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM category

iv. Checkin table = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM checkin

v. elite_years table = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM elite_years

vi. friend table = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM friend

vii. hours table = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM hours

viii. photo table = 
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM photo

ix. review table = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM review
		
x. tip table =  10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM tip

xi. user table = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(*) as RecordsReturned
		FROM user


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id : 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct id) as DistinctRecords
		FROM business

ii. Hours = business_id : 1562
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct business_id) as DistinctRecords
		FROM hours
	
iii. Category = business_id : 2643
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct business_id) as DistinctRecords
		FROM hours
		
iv. Attribute = business_id : 1115 
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct business_id) as DistinctRecords
		FROM attribute
		
v. Review = (id, user_id, business_id) : (10000, 9581, 8090)
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct id) as DistinctIDRecords,
			count(distinct user_id) as DistinctUserIDRecords,
			count(distinct business_id) as DistinctBusinessIDRecords
		FROM review
		
vi. Checkin = business_id : 493
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct business_id) as DistinctRecords
		FROM checkin
		
vii. Photo = (id, business_id) : (10000, 6493)
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct id) as DistinctIDRecords,
			count(distinct business_id) as DistinctBusinessIDRecords
		FROM photo
	
viii. Tip = (user_id, business_id) : (537, 3979)
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct user_id) as DistinctUserIDRecords,
			count(distinct business_id) as DistinctBusinessIDRecords
		FROM tip
		
ix. User = 10000
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct business_id) as DistinctRecords
		FROM user
		
x. Friend = 11
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct business_id) as DistinctRecords
		FROM friend
		
xi. Elite_years = 2780
	Code:
		SELECT count(distinct business_id) as DistinctRecords
		FROM hours
		

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No.
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

		SELECT id,
			name,
			review_count,
			fans,

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	City: Phoenix
	Category: Restaurants
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	2-3 stars restaurants seems to have higher number of working hours compared to 4-5 stars restaurants
	
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    
    Yes and No. Taking the total review counts of each group, the 2-3 stars restaurants have less number of review (68) compared to 4-5 stars (438).
	But taking the individual review counts, we can see that one restaurant from each group have similar number of reviews, 8 and 7 for 2-3 and 4-5 stars restaurant respectively, while the others from each group have much more, 60 and 431 for 2-3 and 4-5 stars restaurant respectively.
	
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	
	Nothing can be infered usiing the location data alone. But using the location data and review count data we could say that the region around postal code 85024-85028 appears to very popular or it could be a highly populated area.
	
SQL code used for analysis:

		SELECT B.id,
			B.name,
			B.city,
			B.state,
			B.postal_code,
			H.hours,
			CASE
				WHEN hours LIKE '%Monday%' THEN 1
				WHEN hours LIKE '%Tuesday%' THEN 2
				WHEN hours LIKE '%Wednesday%' THEN 3
				WHEN hours LIKE '%Thursday%' THEN 4
				WHEN hours LIKE '%Friday%' THEN 5
				WHEN hours LIKE '%Saturday%' THEN 6
				WHEN hours LIKE '%Sunday%' THEN 7
			END as DoH,
			B.stars,
			CASE 
				WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 Stars'
				WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 Stars'
			END as star_range,
			C.category,
			B.review_count
		FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H ON B.id = H.business_id
			INNER JOIN category C ON C.business_id = B.id
		WHERE (city = 'Phoenix' 
			AND category = 'Restaurants')
			AND (B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 
			OR B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
		GROUP BY stars, DoH
		ORDER BY DoH, star_range ASC
		
	Output:

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: Average Star Rating
         The open businesses have higher average star rating than the closed one
		 Open: 3.67900943396 
		 Closed: 3.52039473684
         
ii. Difference 2: Average Review Count
		
		The open businesses have higher average review count than the closed one

         Open: 31.7570754717 
		 Closed: 23.1980263158 
         
SQL code used for analysis:

		SELECT is_open,
			AVG(stars),
			AVG(review_count)
		FROM business
		GROUP BY is_open
		
Output:
		+---------+---------------+-------------------+
		| is_open |    AVG(stars) | AVG(review_count) |
		+---------+---------------+-------------------+
		|       0 | 3.52039473684 |     23.1980263158 |
		|       1 | 3.67900943396 |     31.7570754717 |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
       
		To determine the most popular businesses in each city using maximum average stars
        
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
        
		This analysis requires the use of the 'business' and 'category' table.The city, name and stars columns in the business table and the category column in the category table are used. These two tables are joined using inner join with id and business_id as a common column. This analysis can provide a view on tne typee of business that prevales in a region and can be used to while staring and improving a business.
